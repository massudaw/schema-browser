-- | Partially ordered data types.  The standard 'Prelude.Ord' class is for
-- total orders and therefore not suitable for floating point.  However, we can
-- still define meaningful 'max' and 'sort' functions for these types.
--
-- We define our own 'Ord' class which is intended as a replacement for
-- 'Prelude.Ord'.  However, in order to take advantage of existing libraries
-- which use 'Prelude.Ord', we make every instance of 'Ord' an instance of
-- 'Prelude.Ord'.  This is done using the OverlappingInstances and
-- UndecidableInstances extensions -- it remains to be seen if problems occur
-- as a result of this.
