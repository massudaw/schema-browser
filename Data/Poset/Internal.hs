-- | Class for partially ordered data types where sorting makes sense.
-- This includes all totally ordered sets and floating point types.  Instances
-- should satisfy the following laws:
--
-- * The set of elements for which 'isOrdered' returns true is totally ordered.
--
-- * The max (or min) of an insignificant element and a significant element
-- is the significant one.
--
-- * The result of sorting a list should contain only significant elements.
--
-- * @max a b@ = @max b a@
--
-- * @min a b@ = @min b a@
--
-- The idea comes from floating point types, where non-comparable elements
-- (NaNs) are the exception rather than the rule.  For these types, we can
-- define 'max', 'min' and 'sortBy' to ignore insignificant elements.  Thus, a
-- sort of floating point values will discard all NaNs and order the remaining
-- elements.
